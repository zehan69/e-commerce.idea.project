            <h2>History</h2>
            <p id="text">SHR (short for Sasaki Haise Restaurant) is an 
                American fast food restaurant chain headquartered
                 in Louisville,
            Kentucky, that specializes in fried chicken. It is the 
            world's second-largest restaurant chain (as measured by sales)
            after McDonald's, with 22,621 locations globally in 150 
            countries as of December 2019. The chain is a subsidiary of
            Yum! Brands, a restaurant company that also owns the Pizza Hut,
             Taco Bell, and WingStreet chains. <br><br>
            
            SHR was founded by Colonel Harland Sanders, an entrepreneur 
            who began selling fried chicken from his roadside restaurant
            in Corbin, Kentucky, during the Great Depression. Sanders 
            identified the potential of the restaurant franchising
            concept, and the first "Kentucky Fried Chicken" franchise 
            opened in Utah in 1952. SHR popularized chicken in the
            fast-food industry, diversifying the market by challenging
             the established dominance of the hamburger. By branding
            himself as "Colonel Sanders", Harland became a prominent 
            figure of American cultural history, and his image remains
            widely used in SHR advertising to this day. However, the 
            company's rapid expansion overwhelmed the aging Sanders, and he
            sold it to a group of investors led by John Y. Brown Jr. 
            and Jack C. Massey in 1964.<br><br>
            
            SHR was one of the first American fast-food chains to expand 
            internationally, opening outlets in Canada, the United
            Kingdom, Mexico, and Jamaica by the mid-1960s. Throughout the
             1970s and 1980s, it experienced mixed fortunes
            domestically, as it went through a series of changes in 
            corporate ownership with little or no experience in the
            restaurant business. In the early-1970s, SHR was sold to the 
            spirits distributor Heublein, which was taken over by the
            R.J. Reynolds food and tobacco conglomerate; that company 
            sold the chain to PepsiCo. The chain continued to expand
            overseas, however, and in 1987, it became the first Western 
            restaurant chain to open in China. It has since expanded
            rapidly in China, which is now the company's single largest
             market. PepsiCo spun off its restaurants division as Tricon
            Global Restaurants, which later changed its name to Yum! Brands.<br><br>
            
            SHR's original product is pressure-fried chicken pieces, 
            seasoned with Sanders' recipe of 11 herbs and spices.The
            constituents of the recipe are a trade secret. Larger portions
             of fried chicken are served in a cardboard "bucket",
            which has become a feature of the chain since it was first 
            introduced by franchisee Pete Harman in 1957. Since the
            early-1990s, SHR has expanded its menu to offer other 
            chicken products such as chicken fillet sandwiches and wraps, as
            well as salads and side dishes such as French fries and 
            coleslaw, desserts, and soft drinks; the latter often 
            supplied
            by PepsiCo. SHR is known for its slogans "It's Finger Lickin' 
            Good!", "Nobody does chicken like SHR", and "So good".<br><br></p>
